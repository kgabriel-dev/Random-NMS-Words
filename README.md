# Random NMS Words

This project gatheres nearly all translated words from the game "No Man's Sky" and can present you a random word from this list. The data is gathered from the [No Man's Sky Wiki](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky_Wiki). A live version of this project can be found under [https://nms-words.kgabriel.dev](https://nms-words.kgabriel.dev).

## How to use
If you want to learn a random word from either the language of the Korvax, the Gek, the Vy&#39;keen or the Atlas, visit [https://nms-words.kgabriel.dev](https://nms-words.kgabriel.dev). This page loads a new word on every visit.

If you want to gather the data yourself from the [No Man's Sky Wiki](https://nomanssky.fandom.com/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky_Wiki), you have to run the `scraper.py` script. Before that, activate the virtual environment found in the `venv` folder and install the required packages. The script will create a folder called `dict`, in which you can find the gathered data split by the three languages. The words can be found in the files `Korvax.txt`, `Gek.txt`, `Vy'keen.txt` and `Atlas.txt`.
